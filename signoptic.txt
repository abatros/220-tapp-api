This is what I found:

(1) http://www.kerquest.com/ a single page web site - no links - no products
(2) kerquest registered in a little city in French Alpes capital: 160,000 Euros.
(3) Kerquest seems to be a company with less that 5 employees, with some in Germany.

(4) The owner Yann Boutant, has some interesting scientific publications:

(5) He has also sharing some patents while working at Signoptic Technologies
    The latest one 2018 with Arjo-Solutions (and Royal Canadian Mint!)

(6) The actual CTO for Kerquest is Gaël Rosset : https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaelrosset/
    and in his profile: "Aztekam SAS and Kerquest SAS merge in December 2016"

    Arjo Solutions proposes DOCS (DOcument Certification by Signoptic)

    Arjo Solutions develops Signoptic®, a revolutionary technology for
    individual article level product authentication and identification
    that secures goods to combat counterfeit and grey markets.


CONCLUSIONS:
  There are 3 companies: Kerquest, Aztekam, Signoptic and Arjo-solutions
  with unclear relations.

  The only company that shows real and consistent activity is Signoptic
  based in Paris.
